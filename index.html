        Displays live news and stocks data about various different
        biotechnology and computer science related companies. Uses data
        analysis to analyze different diseases and provide useful information
        about them. Additionally, we also post blogs on our website written by
        high schoolers! You are also free to write a blog on the fields of

      <h3>Who are we...</h3>
      <p>
        We are Tanya Sanghavi and Sri GM, two high school seniors dedicated to
        exploring the fields of biotechnology and computer science. Through
        this website, we aspire to provide useful information about disease
        analysis, educational blogs about biotechnology and computer science,
        and live data on news and stocks.

          <p style="font-size:2rem;">In a research conducted by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie
            Mellon University, the researchers studied the fossil of a marine organism called "Pleurocystitids" that is
            450 Million years old. Not only did they study it, but they also used Robotics and Biotechnology to build a
            soft botic replica of the organism. The researchers intend to use softbotics (using flexible electronics and
            soft materials to build a robot), to understand the movements and the design of the organisms that existed
            even before the existence of humans. They have also created a new field of study called "PaleoBionics"
            through which researchers are going to examine the fossils and remains of animals that existed before the
            human era. Through this, they would like to study the evolution and the bio-mechanical factors responsible
            for evolution.</p>
