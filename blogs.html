              <p style="font-size:2rem;">In a research conducted by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, the researchers studied the fossil of a marine organism called "Pleurocystitids" that is 450 Million years old. Not only did they study it, but they also used Robotics and Biotechnology to build a soft botic replica of the organism. The researchers intend to use softbotics (using flexible electronics and soft materials to build a robot), to understand the movements and the design of the organisms that existed even before the existence of humans. They have also created a new field of study called "PaleoBionics" through which researchers are going to examine the fossils and remains of animals that existed before the human era. Through this, they would like to study the evolution and the bio-mechanical factors responsible for evolution.</p>
